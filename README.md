# Poly Chess

Poly Chess is an easy to use chess bot for Discord

This repo is based off an Autocode app ([chessisfakenews](https://autocode.com/app/lifn/chessisfakenews)), the original standard lib code remains in the [lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps](https://github.com/lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps)

There are plans for a TypeScript rewrite.
Please expect this around July - August 2024
